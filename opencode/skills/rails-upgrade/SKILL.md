## Dependencies

- **rails-load-defaults skill** ([github.com/ombulabs/claude-code_rails-load-defaults-skill](https://github.com/ombulabs/claude-code_rails-load-defaults-skill)) — Handles incremental `load_defaults` updates with tiered risk assessment (Tier 1: low-risk, Tier 2: needs codebase grep, Tier 3: requires human review). Must be installed for Step 2 of the upgrade workflow.
- **dual-boot skill** ([github.com/ombulabs/claude-code_dual-boot-skill](https://github.com/ombulabs/claude-code_dual-boot-skill)) — Sets up and manages dual-boot environments using the `next_rails` gem. Covers setup, `NextRails.next?` code patterns, CI configuration, and post-upgrade cleanup. Must be installed for Step 4 of the upgrade workflow.

---

## Core Methodology (FastRuby.io Approach)

This skill follows the proven FastRuby.io upgrade methodology:

1. **Incremental Upgrades** - Always upgrade one minor/major version at a time
2. **Assessment First** - Understand scope before making changes
3. **Dual-Boot Testing** - Test both versions during transition using `next_rails` gem
4. **Test Coverage** - Ensure adequate test coverage before upgrading (aim for 80%+)
5. **Gem Compatibility** - Check gem compatibility at each step using RailsBump
6. **Deprecation Warnings** - Address deprecations before upgrading
7. **Backwards Compatible Changes** - Deploy small changes to production before version bump

**Key Resources:**
- **DELEGATE** to the `dual-boot` skill for dual-boot setup with `next_rails` (see Dependencies)
- See `reference/deprecation-warnings.md` for managing deprecations
- See `reference/staying-current.md` for maintaining upgrades over time

---

## CRITICAL: Dual-Boot Code Pattern with `NextRails.next?`

When proposing code fixes that must work with both the current and target Rails versions (dual-boot), **always use `NextRails.next?` from the `next_rails` gem** — never use `respond_to?` or other feature-detection patterns.

**DELEGATE** to the `dual-boot` skill for:
- Setup and initialization (`next_rails --init`, `Gemfile.next`)
- `NextRails.next?` code patterns and examples
- CI configuration for dual-boot testing
- Post-upgrade cleanup (removing dual-boot branches)

**DEPENDENCY:** Requires the [dual-boot skill](https://github.com/ombulabs/claude-code_dual-boot-skill)

---

## Core Workflow (5-Step Process)

### Step 0: Verify Latest Patch Version (MANDATORY PRE-STEP)
- **CRITICAL:** Before any upgrade work begins, verify the app is on the latest patch release of its current Rails series
- Read `Gemfile.lock` to find the exact current Rails version (e.g., `3.2.19`)
- Compare against the latest patch for that series:
  - **EOL series (≤ 6.1):** Use the static table in `reference/multi-hop-strategy.md`
  - **Active series (≥ 7.0):** Query the RubyGems API at runtime (see `reference/multi-hop-strategy.md` for commands)
- If the app is NOT on the latest patch:
  - Inform user: "Your app is on Rails X.Y.Z but the latest patch is X.Y.W — you should upgrade to the latest patch first"
  - Guide user through updating the Gemfile and running `bundle update rails`
  - Run test suite after patch upgrade to verify nothing broke
  - Deploy patch upgrade before proceeding with the minor/major version hop
- If the app IS on the latest patch → Proceed to Step 1
- **Why:** Patch releases contain security fixes, bug fixes, and additional deprecation warnings that make the next version hop safer and easier to debug

### Step 1: Run Test Suite (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
- **CRITICAL:** Before any upgrade work begins, run the existing test suite
- Claude executes `bundle exec rspec` or `bundle exec rails test` to verify baseline
- All tests MUST pass before proceeding with any upgrade
- If tests fail, stop and help user fix failing tests first
- Record test count and coverage as baseline metrics
- See `workflows/test-suite-verification-workflow.md` for details

### Step 2: Verify load_defaults Matches Current Rails Version
- **CRITICAL:** Check if `load_defaults` in `config/application.rb` matches the current Rails gem version
- **DELEGATE** to the `rails-load-defaults` skill for detection and incremental update
- That skill handles tiered, per-config updates with test runs between each change
- If `load_defaults` matches current Rails version → Proceed to Step 3
- **DEPENDENCY:** Requires the [rails-load-defaults skill](https://github.com/ombulabs/claude-code_rails-load-defaults-skill)

### Step 3: Run Breaking Changes Detection (DIRECT)
- **Claude runs detection checks directly** using Grep, Glob, and Read tools
- No script generation - Claude searches the codebase in real-time
- Finds issues with file:line references
- Collects all findings immediately
- See `workflows/direct-detection-workflow.md` for patterns to search

### Step 4: Generate Reports Based on Findings
- **Comprehensive Upgrade Report**: Breaking changes analysis with OLD vs NEW code examples, custom code warnings with ⚠️ flags, step-by-step migration plan, testing checklist and rollback plan
- **app:update Preview Report**: Shows exact configuration file changes (OLD vs NEW), lists new files to be created, impact assessment (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

---

## Trigger Patterns

Claude should activate this skill when user says:

**Upgrade Requests:**
- "Upgrade my Rails app to [version]"
- "Help me upgrade from Rails [x] to [y]"
- "What breaking changes are in Rails [version]?"
- "Plan my upgrade from [x] to [y]"
- "What Rails version am I using?"
- "Analyze my Rails app for upgrade"
- "Find breaking changes in my code"
- "Check my app for Rails [version] compatibility"

**Specific Report Requests:**
- "Show me the app:update changes"
- "Preview configuration changes for Rails [version]"
- "Generate the upgrade report"
- "What will change if I upgrade?"

---

## CRITICAL: Sequential Upgrade Strategy

### ⚠️ Version Skipping is NOT Allowed

Rails upgrades MUST follow a sequential path. Examples:

**For Rails 5.x to 8.x:**
```
5.0.x → 5.1.x → 5.2.x → 6.0.x → 6.1.x → 7.0.x → 7.1.x → 7.2.x → 8.0.x → 8.1.x
```

**You CANNOT skip versions.** Examples:
- ❌ 5.2 → 6.1 (skips 6.0)
- ❌ 6.0 → 7.0 (skips 6.1)
- ❌ 7.0 → 8.0 (skips 7.1 and 7.2)
- ✅ 5.2 → 6.0 (correct)
- ✅ 7.0 → 7.1 (correct)
- ✅ 7.2 → 8.0 (correct)

If user requests a multi-hop upgrade (e.g., 5.2 → 8.1):
1. Explain the sequential requirement
2. Break it into individual hops
3. Generate separate reports for each hop
4. Recommend completing each hop fully before moving to next

## High-Level Workflow

When user requests an upgrade, follow this workflow:

### Step 0: Verify Latest Patch Version (MANDATORY PRE-STEP)
```
⚠️  THIS STEP IS REQUIRED BEFORE ANY OTHER WORK

1. Read Gemfile.lock to find exact current Rails version (e.g., 3.2.19)
2. Compare against latest patch for that series:
   - EOL series (≤ 6.1): use static table in reference/multi-hop-strategy.md
   - Active series (≥ 7.0): query RubyGems API (see reference/multi-hop-strategy.md for commands)
3. If current version < latest patch:
   - INFORM user: "Your app is on Rails X.Y.Z but the latest patch is X.Y.W"
   - Guide through Gemfile update and bundle update rails
   - Run test suite after patch upgrade
   - Deploy patch upgrade before proceeding
   - Do NOT proceed to next minor/major until on latest patch
4. If current version == latest patch:
   - Proceed to Step 1
```

### Step 1: Run Test Suite (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
```
⚠️  THIS STEP IS REQUIRED BEFORE ANY OTHER WORK

1. Read: workflows/test-suite-verification-workflow.md
2. Detect test framework (RSpec, Minitest, or both)
3. Run test suite with: bundle exec rspec OR bundle exec rails test
4. Capture results: total tests, passing, failing, pending
5. If ANY tests fail:
   - STOP the upgrade process
   - Report failing tests to user
   - Offer to help fix failing tests
   - Do NOT proceed until all tests pass
6. If all tests pass:
   - Record baseline metrics (test count, coverage if available)
   - Proceed to Step 2
```

### Step 2: Detect Current Version & Verify load_defaults (BLOCKING STEP)
```
⚠️  THIS STEP MAY BLOCK THE UPGRADE

1. Read Gemfile to find current Rails gem version
2. Read config/application.rb for load_defaults version
3. Compare rails_gem_version with load_defaults_version
4. If load_defaults_version < rails_gem_version:
   - DELEGATE to the rails-load-defaults skill for incremental update
   - That skill walks through each config change one at a time, grouped by risk tier
   - Tests are re-run between each change
   - Do NOT proceed until load_defaults matches the current Rails version
5. If load_defaults_version == rails_gem_version:
   - Proceed to Step 3
```

### Step 3: Set Up Dual-Boot with next_rails (IF NOT ALREADY SET UP)
```
DELEGATE to the dual-boot skill for setup and initialization.
That skill handles:
- Checking if Gemfile.next already exists (to avoid duplicate next? method)
- Adding next_rails gem and running next_rails --init
- Installing dependencies for both Rails versions
- Configuring the Gemfile with if next? conditionals
```

### Step 4: Validate Upgrade Path
```
1. Check if upgrade is single-hop or multi-hop
2. If multi-hop, explain sequential requirement
3. Plan individual hops
```

### Step 5: Run Breaking Changes Detection (DIRECT)
```
Claude runs detection directly using tools - NO script generation needed

1. Read: workflows/direct-detection-workflow.md
2. Read: detection-scripts/patterns/rails-{VERSION}-patterns.yml
3. For each pattern in the patterns file:
   - Use Grep tool to search for the pattern
   - Collect file paths and line numbers
   - Store findings with context
4. Read: version-guides/upgrade-{FROM}-to-{TO}.md for context
5. Compile all findings into structured data
```

### Step 6: Load Report Resources & Generate Reports
```
1. Read: templates/upgrade-report-template.md
2. Read: templates/app-update-preview-template.md
3. Read: workflows/upgrade-report-workflow.md
4. Read: workflows/app-update-preview-workflow.md
```

**Deliverable #1: Comprehensive Upgrade Report**
- **Input:** Direct detection findings + version guide data
- **Output:** Report with real code examples from user's project

**Deliverable #2: app:update Preview**
- **Input:** Actual config files + findings
- **Output:** Preview with real file paths and changes

### Step 7: Present Reports & Offer Help
```
1. Present Comprehensive Upgrade Report first
2. Present app:update Preview Report second
3. Explain next steps
4. Offer to help implement changes
```

## Pre-Upgrade Checklist (FastRuby.io Best Practices)

Before starting ANY upgrade:

### 1. Test Coverage Assessment (AUTOMATED - Step 1 of Workflow)
- [x] Run test suite - all tests passing? **← Claude runs this automatically**
- [x] Check test coverage (aim for >70%) **← Claude captures this if SimpleCov is configured**
- [ ] Review critical paths have coverage

**Note:** This step is now automated. Claude will run the test suite and BLOCK the upgrade if any tests fail.

### 2. Dependency Audit
- [ ] Run `bundle outdated`
- [ ] Check gem compatibility with target Rails version
- [ ] Identify gems that need upgrading first

### 3. Database Backup
- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Backup development/staging databases
- [ ] Verify backup restore process works

### 4. Git Branch Strategy
- [ ] Create upgrade branch from main/master
- [ ] Set up CI for upgrade branch
- [ ] Plan merge strategy

### 5. Deprecation Warnings
- [ ] Run app with `RAILS_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS=1`
- [ ] Address existing deprecation warnings
- [ ] Enable verbose deprecations in test environment

---

## Common Request Patterns

### Pattern 1: Full Upgrade Request
**User says:** "Upgrade my Rails app to 8.1"

**Action - Step 0 (MANDATORY: Verify Latest Patch):**
1. Read `Gemfile.lock` for exact Rails version
2. Compare against latest patch for that series (see `reference/multi-hop-strategy.md`)
3. If not on latest patch → Guide user through patch upgrade first
4. If on latest patch → Proceed to Step 1

**Action - Step 1 (MANDATORY: Verify Tests Pass):**
1. Load: `workflows/test-suite-verification-workflow.md`
2. Detect test framework (RSpec or Minitest)
3. Run test suite: `bundle exec rspec` or `bundle exec rails test`
4. If tests FAIL → STOP and help fix tests first
5. If tests PASS → Record baseline and proceed

**Action - Step 2 (MANDATORY: Verify load_defaults):**
1. Read Gemfile.lock for current Rails gem version
2. Read config/application.rb for load_defaults version
3. If load_defaults < Rails gem version:
   - INFORM user: "Your app uses Rails X.Y but load_defaults is set to X.Z"
   - DELEGATE to the `rails-load-defaults` skill for incremental, tiered update
   - That skill handles per-config analysis, test runs, and risk assessment
4. If load_defaults matches → Proceed to Step 3

**Action - Step 3 (Run Detection Directly):**
1. Validate upgrade path
2. Load: `workflows/direct-detection-workflow.md`
3. Load: `detection-scripts/patterns/rails-{VERSION}-patterns.yml`
4. Use Grep/Glob/Read tools to search for each pattern
5. Collect findings with file:line references

**Action - Step 4 (Generate Reports):**
1. Load: `workflows/upgrade-report-workflow.md`
2. Load: `workflows/app-update-preview-workflow.md`
3. Generate Comprehensive Upgrade Report (using direct findings)
4. Generate app:update Preview (using actual config files)
5. Present both reports to user
6. Offer to help implement changes

### Pattern 2: Multi-Hop Request
**User says:** "Help me upgrade from Rails 5.2 to 8.1"

**Action - Step 0 (MANDATORY: Verify Latest Patch):**
1. Check exact current version from `Gemfile.lock`
2. If not on latest patch of current series → Upgrade to latest patch first
3. For multi-hop: This check applies at the START and again after each hop

**Action - Step 1 (MANDATORY: Verify Tests Pass):**
1. Run test suite BEFORE planning any upgrade work
2. If tests fail → STOP and fix first
3. If tests pass → Proceed with planning

**Action - Step 2 (MANDATORY: Verify load_defaults):**
1. Check if load_defaults matches current Rails version
2. If mismatched → Recommend updating load_defaults FIRST
3. For multi-hop: Ensure load_defaults is current before starting

**Action - Step 3 (Plan & Execute):**
1. Explain sequential requirement
2. Calculate hops: 5.2 → 6.0 → 6.1 → 7.0 → 7.1 → 7.2 → 8.0 → 8.1
3. Reference: `reference/multi-hop-strategy.md`
4. Follow Pattern 1 for FIRST hop (5.2 → 6.0)
5. After first hop complete, repeat for next hops
6. **IMPORTANT:** After each hop, ensure load_defaults is updated before next hop

### Pattern 3: Breaking Changes Analysis Only
**User says:** "What breaking changes affect my app for Rails 8.0?"

**Action - Step 0 (MANDATORY: Verify Latest Patch):**
1. Check if on latest patch — warn if not, recommend patching first

**Action - Step 1 (MANDATORY: Verify Tests Pass):**
1. Run test suite first
2. If tests fail → Warn user and recommend fixing first
3. If tests pass → Proceed with analysis

**Action - Step 2 (MANDATORY: Verify load_defaults):**
1. Check load_defaults alignment
2. If mismatched → Recommend updating first

**Action - Step 3 (Run Detection):**
1. Load: `workflows/direct-detection-workflow.md`
2. Run detection directly using tools
3. Present findings summary
4. Offer to generate full upgrade report

## Key Principles

1. **ALWAYS Verify Latest Patch First** (MANDATORY - ensure app is on latest patch of current series before any version hop)
2. **ALWAYS Run Test Suite** (MANDATORY - no exceptions, no upgrade work until tests pass)
3. **Block on Failing Tests** (if tests fail, STOP and help fix them before any upgrade work)
4. **ALWAYS Verify load_defaults** (MANDATORY - check if load_defaults matches current Rails version)
5. **Recommend Updating load_defaults First** (if behind current Rails, update load_defaults BEFORE upgrading to next version)
6. **Run Detection Directly** (use Grep/Glob/Read tools - no script generation needed)
7. **Always Use Actual Findings** (no generic examples in reports)
8. **Always Flag Custom Code** (with ⚠️ warnings based on detected issues)
9. **Always Use Templates** (for consistency)
10. **Always Check Quality** (before delivery)
11. **Load Workflows as Needed** (don't hold everything in memory)
12. **Sequential Process is Critical** (patch check → tests → load_defaults check → detection → reports)
13. **Follow FastRuby.io Methodology** (incremental upgrades, assessment first)
14. **Always Use `NextRails.next?` for Dual-Boot Code** (NEVER use `respond_to?` for version branching. DELEGATE to the `dual-boot` skill for patterns and setup.)
