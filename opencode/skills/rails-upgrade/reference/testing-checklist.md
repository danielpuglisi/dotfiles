# Testing Checklist for Rails Upgrades

**Comprehensive testing checklist based on FastRuby.io methodology**

## Pre-Upgrade Testing

### 1. Current State Verification

- [ ] All existing tests pass

### 3. After rails app:update

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploy
- [ ] Staging tests complete
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Team notified of deployment
- [ ] Low-traffic window chosen
- [ ] Database backup taken

### During Deploy
- [ ] Monitor deployment progress
- [ ] Watch for deployment errors
- [ ] Verify workers restart

### After Deploy (First 15 minutes)
- [ ] Application responds
- [ ] Check error tracking for spikes
- [ ] Verify key user flows work
- [ ] Monitor response times
- [ ] Check background jobs processing

### After Deploy (First hour)
- [ ] Error rate normal
- [ ] Performance metrics stable
- [ ] No user complaints
- [ ] Jobs backlog clearing

### After Deploy (First day)
- [ ] Review all errors
- [ ] Check for edge cases
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Gather user feedback

---

## Rollback Triggers

Rollback immediately if:

- [ ] Error rate > 2x normal
- [ ] Response time > 3x normal
- [ ] Critical feature broken
- [ ] Data integrity issues
- [ ] Security vulnerability discovered
- [ ] External service integration broken

---

## Test Environment Setup

```bash
# Run tests with Rails next version
RAILS_NEXT=1 bundle exec rspec

# Run with verbose deprecation warnings
RUBYOPT="-W:deprecated" bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test file
bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb

# Run with coverage
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec
```

---

## Common Test Fixes

### 1. Time-dependent tests
```ruby
# Use travel_to instead of fixed times
travel_to Time.zone.local(2024, 1, 1) do
  # test code
end
```

### 2. Database cleanup
```ruby
# Ensure proper cleanup between tests
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.use_transactional_fixtures = true
end
```

### 3. Asset pipeline tests
```ruby
# Stub asset methods if needed
allow(helper).to receive(:asset_path).and_return("/assets/test.png")
```
